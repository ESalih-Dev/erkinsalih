      page. The Watch History page depended on a deprecated service by another
      time and from our metrics was the slowest page under our ownership by a
      large margin. After a complete rewrite and redesign giving customers
      day-by-day visibility as well as episode visibility we reduced load times
      drastically and saw 1000 fold increase in customer traffic.

      As part of international expansion, Prime Video introduced support for RTL
      languages (specifically Arabic and Hebrew). As part of the
      cross-functional across Web I took part in contributing to the component
      library and improving coding standards to allow for current and future
      support of RTL languages.

      To advance from SDE I to SDE II, I performed as a consultant engineer -
      reviewing architecture designs and performing code reviews as well as
      partaking in the hiring loop interviewing potential SDE I's.

      I was also part of the on-call rota dedicated to "operational excellence"
      involving be the POC for diagnosing and fixing software issues in
      production.
