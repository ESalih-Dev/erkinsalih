    <p>
      Mindful Chef's FE codebase was originally built scrappily by an agency; a
      strong focus of mine was improving the performance. I migrated the Express
      web server to use built-in Next.js server which improved the Lighthouse
      score by 25 points.

    <p>
      We massively lacked visibility when customers were hitting bugs/errors on
      the website (specifically in the sign-up flow as customers were contacting
      CS for support). I investigated and documented customer failure points and
      provided insight to leadership into the disconnect between back-end and
      front-end and lead the work to surface metrics into DataDog for engineer +
      product visibility.
