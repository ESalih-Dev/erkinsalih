      Made one-to-many relationships visible in the front-end (integrating with
      a new API to provide this data), along with providing customers an
      improved UX for clearer visibility on the "many" side of the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outlined and documented multiple performance issues with the front-end
      architecture affecting both local development and production. Investigated
      and diagnosed how to fix page load time in local development (~7 seconds
      to load a single page). Produced a fully functioning SSR demo of the
      landing page (pre-existing app is entirely client-side fetch + render)
      showing an 80% reduction in LCP performance.
