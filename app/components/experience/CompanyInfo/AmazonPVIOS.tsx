    <p>
      The goal of my placement was to better understand customer pain points as
      they used the Prime Video iOS app. To identify performance issue I built a
      profiler dedicated to collecting anonymised customer performance metrics
      (fps/CPU performance/RAM usage) as customers navigated screens and
      interacted with pages. This project formed the basis of a larger movement
      to better understand performance faults which can affect customer
      satisfaction but not to the extent of customers contacting CS.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ingest metrics we used a serverless backend in AWS using Cognito,
      Lambda, Aurora and S3. The data was presented in a React front-end
      displaying real-time graph data as customers interacted with the app.
